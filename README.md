# Subspecies of Sunflowers Project

## Overview
This project involves the collection, preparation, modeling, and analysis of images of various sunflower subspecies. The goal is to develop a neural network model to classify different sunflower subspecies based on their flower sizes, colors, and growth habits. The project is divided into three roles: Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Data Analyst, each with specific tasks.
